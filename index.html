							<h2>Who I Am Professionally</h2>
							<p>I started out learning Ruby and Rails development in 2014 and completed both Skillcrush’s <a href="https://skillcrush.com/program/learn-ruby/" target="_blank">Ruby blueprint</a> and Treehouse’s <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jesspendley" target="_blank">Ruby and Ruby on Rails</a> tracks, so I’m familiar with the language and framework. I switched to Java and Android development about two years ago, but I’m confident that I can pick anything back up that I need to. Admittedly, I am just starting out my development career. Lucky for me that’s just what you’re looking for! </p>

							<p>My skills include: Android, Java, SQL, Ruby/Rails, Javascript/jQuery, HTML/CSS, and AMPscript. I’m also currently working to add Kotlin (because of <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-a-programming-language-8933d5e749ed#.y4sn2sn03" target="_blank">this article</a>) and Lua (because of <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank">this awesomness</a>) to the list.</p>

							<p>If you are interested in where I’ve been, here’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8X68JGDlS0ndnBSRUZobVZUM2c/view" target="_blank">my resume</a>.</p>

							<h2>Who I Am Personally</h2>
							<p>I’m a writer at heart. I actually went to college for comparative literature and do a lot of (so far, unpublished) writing in my spare time. My medium of choice - for reading and writing - is comic books. I have strong opinions about them. </p>

							<p>In addition to writing comic scripts, I work on tabletop projects, game, hike, practice Systema, and maintain a primal lifestyle. All of the above I’m lucky enough to do with my husband, Keith.</p>

							<p>My most recent passion is 2D game development - especially tiny game development. I’ve been working on several projects with my sister Tayler who, besides being my all around dev training partner, created all of the awesome art for this site. </p>

							<h2>Why I Want To Work With You</h2>
							<blockquote>“…Instead there’s a lot of future perfect people. People who have the potential to become the perfect person in the perfect role if just given the right opportunity.”<br><br>

							- Jason Fried, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3660-the-person-theyll-become" target="_blank">“The Person They’ll Become”</a></blockquote>

							<p>When I first read that article, I fell in love. Just a little bit.</p>

							<p>Up to that point, I had heard of various companies and startups that had the “perfect” culture. The right mission statement and values to pull their employees in and make the top of important lists at Fast Company or Forbes. But it always felt like something that wasn’t really…real. Just things meant to affect the top 1% of employees and look good in blurbs.</p>

							<p>After I finished reading that first article on Signal v. Noise, I dove in and started reading more. ““Eat, sleep, code, repeat” is such bullshit”, “I’m not sure if I like what I did here or not”, and “I’m a boring programmer (and proud of it)” are just a few of the many articles that stood out, and when I finished I could tell I was in deep.</p>

							<p>I want to work for Basecamp because you’re the real deal. You invest in people, personally and professionally, and you really give them the room and encouragement to grow. Beyond serving up an amazing product that you truly believe in, you believe in the people that work for you too. </p>

							<p>That’s something that I want to be a part of.</p>

							<h2>Why You Want To Work With Me</h2>
							<p>I didn’t start out in tech.</p> 

							<p>I wasn’t hacking as a teenager or doing web design during college. I didn’t fit any of the tropes that encourage someone to pursue a career like this one, but what I have always had was the ability to study and adapt (and the inability to realize when something isn’t “possible”).</p>

							<p>I’m a life-long, self-guided learner. I’m always testing my own boundaries and trying something new, and I’m not afraid to admit when I don’t know something. I see ignorance as an opportunity and I thrive in an environment where I’m encouraged to ask questions, try, make mistakes, and try again.</p>

							<p>I’ve worked really hard to get where I am, and I know that I will continue to learn and grow for a long time. You’re a company that invests in the potential of people. I can promise a return on that investment.</p>

							<h2>Question Two</h2>
							<blockquote>Please draft a reply to an email from a security researcher reporting that they have found an XSS in Basecamp, leading to full account takeover. How would you acknowledge the report, and what questions would you ask to help triage the issue? If you’d like to describe your thought process too, that would be really helpful.</blockquote>
