							<h2>Who I Am Professionally</h2>
							<p>I started out learning Ruby and Rails development in 2014 and completed both Skillcrush’s <a href="https://skillcrush.com/program/learn-ruby/" target="_blank">Ruby blueprint</a> and Treehouse’s <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/jesspendley" target="_blank">Ruby and Ruby on Rails</a> tracks, so I’m familiar with the language and framework. I switched to Java and Android development about two years ago, but I’m confident that I can pick anything back up that I need to. <br><br>

							Admittedly, I am just starting out my development career. I may not have had the courage to take the leap now, but when I read your post and it said that you were interested in beginner developers, it sort of felt like kismet. </p>

							<p>My skills include: Android, Java, SQL, Ruby/Rails, Javascript/jQuery, HTML/CSS, and AMPscript. I’m also currently working to add Kotlin (because of <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/how-i-fell-in-love-with-a-programming-language-8933d5e749ed#.y4sn2sn03" target="_blank">this article</a>) and Lua (because of <a href="http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php" target="_blank">this awesomness</a>) to the list.</p>

							<p>If you are interested in where I’ve been, here’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8X68JGDlS0ndnBSRUZobVZUM2c/view" target="_blank">my resume</a>.</p>

							<h2>Who I Am Personally</h2>
							<p>I’m a writer at heart. I actually went to college for comparative literature and do a lot of (so far, unpublished) writing in my spare time. My medium of choice - for reading and writing - is comic books. I have strong opinions about them. </p>

							<p>In addition to writing comic scripts, I work on tabletop projects, game, hike, practice Systema, and maintain a primal lifestyle. All of the above I’m lucky enough to do with my husband, Keith.</p>

							<p>My most recent passion is 2D game development - especially tiny game development. I’ve been working on several projects with my sister Tayler who, besides being my all around dev training partner, created all of the awesome art for this site. </p>

							<h2>Why I Want To Work With You</h2>
							<blockquote>“…Instead there’s a lot of future perfect people. People who have the potential to become the perfect person in the perfect role if just given the right opportunity.”<br><br>

							- Jason Fried, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3660-the-person-theyll-become" target="_blank">“The Person They’ll Become”</a></blockquote>

							<p>When I first read that article, I fell in love. Just a little bit.</p>

							<p>Up to that point, I had heard of various companies and startups that had the “perfect” culture. The right mission statement and values to pull their employees in and make the top of important lists at Fast Company or Forbes. But it always felt like something that wasn’t really…real. Just things meant to affect the top 1% of employees and look good in blurbs.</p>

							<p>After I finished reading that first article on Signal v. Noise, I dove in and started reading more. ““Eat, sleep, code, repeat” is such bullshit”, “I’m not sure if I like what I did here or not”, and “I’m a boring programmer (and proud of it)” are just a few of the many articles that stood out, and when I finished I could tell I was in deep.</p>

							<p>I want to work for Basecamp because you’re the real deal. You invest in people, personally and professionally, and you really give them the room and encouragement to grow. Beyond serving up an amazing product that you truly believe in, you believe in the people that work for you too. </p>

							<p>That’s something that I want to be a part of.</p>

							<h2>Why You Want To Work With Me</h2>
							<p>I didn’t start out in tech.</p> 

							<p>I wasn’t hacking as a teenager or doing web design during college. I didn’t fit any of the tropes that encourage someone to pursue a career like this one, but what I have always had was the ability to study and adapt (and the inability to realize when something isn’t “possible”).</p>

							<p>I’m a life-long, self-guided learner. I’m always testing my own boundaries and trying something new, and I’m not afraid to admit when I don’t know something. I see ignorance as an opportunity and I thrive in an environment where I’m encouraged to ask questions, try, make mistakes, and try again.</p>

							<p>I’ve worked really hard to get where I am, and I know that I will continue to learn and grow for a long time. You’re a company that invests in the potential of people. I can promise a return on that investment.</p>

							<h2>Question One</h2>
							<blockquote>Tell us about who you are, and why you’d be a great addition to the team here.</blockquote>

							<p>Even though I covered that pretty well in the <i>About Me</i> and <i>Why You Want To Work With Me</i> sections, here are the bullet points:</p>
							<p>
							* I'm a self-guided and self-driven learner<br>
							* I'm malleable.<br>
							* I'm a writer.<br>
							* I'm not afraid to take risks or be challenged.<br>
							* I'll mesh well with your culture.<br>
							* You invest in people, and I'm worth the investment.<br>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<h2>Question Two</h2>
							<blockquote>Please draft a reply to an email from a security researcher reporting that they have found an XSS in Basecamp, leading to full account takeover. How would you acknowledge the report, and what questions would you ask to help triage the issue? If you’d like to describe your thought process too, that would be really helpful.</blockquote>

							<p>This is honestly not something that I've had experience doing before. At my current employer, the teams that triage issues like this are separated from support/engineering, so this is something that I had to do some research on. I'm thankful for the opportunity to learn and stretch my wings, and I'm confident that this is a skill that I can develop further.</p>

							<p><i>"Hi Danesh,<br><br>

							We appreciate your report. The security of our customer's data is our highest priority, so if you could provide me with a few more details we can begin this triage process immediately. <br><br>

							* Would you mind providing me with the steps that you took so that we can reproduce the issue?<br><br>

							* Would you mind providing any relevant screenshots of the process? The clearer picture we can provide the faster we can resolve this issue. <br><br>

							Thank you again for your time. As I wait for the requested details I will alert our internal teams to this potential vulnerability. <br><br>

							Regards, <br>

							Jess Pendley"</i><br><br>

							While waiting on the details for the follow up email I would alert relevant internal personel to the issue and check for any similar reports that are already being triaged. </p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-12">
							<h2>Question Three</h2>
							<blockquote>Please describe what steps you would take to diagnose a report that some images aren’t loading in a customer’s Basecamp account.</blockquote>

							<p>All of this is assuming that I am the person in control of communication with the customer. If not, then I would proceed through these steps in tandem with the assigned support rep and provide them with next steps for the customer. <br><br>

							1) I would ask the customer if these images were loading as expected previously, or if these are newly added images. If the images were just added, I would ask for the file types and sizes to make sure that they're supported/within parameters. I would also verify whether this is happening across all of their projects or if this is isolated to a single project.<br><br>

							<i>"Hi Kim, <br><br>

							I am looking into this for you, but before we proceed I just need you to verify a few things for me. <br><br>

							Are these newly added images or did they exist in the project previously and now won't load? If they are new, would you mind providing me with copies of the images? Would you also verify the project that's experiencing this issue?<br><br>

							Regards, <br>

							Jess Pendley"</i><br><br>

							2) I would impersonate into the account in question and verify the behavior that the customer is experiencing. <br><br>

							3) I would email the customer, explaining that I can see the issue and am currently working toward resolution. <br><br>

							<i>"Hi Kim, <br><br>

							I can see exactly what you're talking about. Let me dig into this further and I'll update as soon as I have more information. <br><br>

							Regards, <br>
							Jess Pendley"</i><br><br>

							4) I would check backend data for any tell-tale error messages and follow those accordingly. If the error message is one that is resolvable by myself and/or my team, I would proceed accordingly. If the error message pointed to a previously unknown issue or an issue outside of the scope of my team, I would take the necessary steps to engage dev or ops. <br><br>

							5) I would email the customer again, with either my solution or confirmation of next steps and next expected communication. <br><br>

							<i>"Hi Kim, <br><br>

							After researching this further it looks like this may be something that our internal dev team will need to take a deeper look at. I will update you as soon as I have more information, or by tomorrow afternoon at the latest. <br><br>

							In the interim, let me know if you need anything else. <br><br>

							Regards, <br>

							Jess Pendley"</i></p>
